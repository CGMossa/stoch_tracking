## Syllabus

Syllabus specified over the project course weeks:

1. Explore tractography dataset; Establish the target problem; BVP tracking
    a probabilisitic numerics setting. Find a phantom/generative model for the
    target problem.
    "Brief Survey of Stochastic Numerical Methods" in (@old_book).
2. Primer on Stochastic/Random Ordinary Differential Equations in Chapter 1, 2, 3 and 5
    of (@rode_book).
3. Ito Stochastic Calculus; Chapter 2 and 3 of (@old_book).
4. Modelling with Stochastic Differential Equations; Chapter 6 of (@old_book),
    specifically chap. 6.4, 6.6.
5. Pathwise Approximations; Chap. 9 of (@old_book) and multi-step schemes chap 11.4 of
    (@old_book).
6. Direct Simulation fo Trajectories; Chapter 13.1 of (@old_book).

During the course, there will be methods applied to tractography, and for the latest
numerical schemes and example code, see (@scheme_r_book).
