Examination: 5 oral presentations over the study period.

The course will be held in conjunction with a research stay.

## TODO

- [ ] Read and implement the stuff written in [Probabilistic numerics and 
    uncertainty in computations](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspa.2015.0142).
- [ ] Deliver first draft of the course to Aasa Feragen ASAP.

## Meeting notes

### Meeting 20200904

> Meeting with Tariq, Aasa, and Mossa.

We'll aim to make it as close to data as possible.

The setup is solving $\gamma(t) = \underline v$ in which $\gamma(0)$ and
$\gamma(1)$ are given.

The course work will begin at the end of October 2020, and most likely finish
at the latest in December 2020 or January 2021.

Mossa will have his environment change at DTU for some time to do this.

Aasa will deliver some data + code on [tractography](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tractography#:~:text=In%20neuroscience%2C%20tractography%20is%20a,and%20computer%2Dbased%20diffusion%20MRI.).
